# Twitch

Using Subtide for live stream translation on Twitch.

---

## Overview

Subtide supports Twitch streams with real-time transcription and translation:

- **Live transcription** using Whisper
- **Real-time translation** of spoken content
- **Overlay subtitles** that don't interfere with the stream

---

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to any Twitch stream
2. Look for the **Subtide controls** in the player
3. Click to start translation
4. Subtitles appear as the streamer speaks

> **Warning:** Requirements
> Twitch translation requires **Tier 2 or higher** since live streams don't have pre-existing subtitles.

---

## How It Works

1. **Audio Capture** - The extension captures audio from the stream
2. **Transcription** - Whisper processes audio chunks in real-time
3. **Translation** - LLM translates the transcribed text
4. **Display** - Subtitles appear with minimal delay

---

## Controls

### Translation Toggle

Located in the Twitch player controls:

- Click to start/stop translation
- Icon indicates active state

### Subtitle Display

- **Position**: Adjustable via drag-and-drop
- **Size**: Configurable in the menu
- **Style**: Matches Subtide's dark theme

---

## Configuration

For best results with Twitch:

### Backend Settings

```bash
# Recommended for live streaming
WHISPER_MODEL=base  # Fast processing
WHISPER_BACKEND=mlx  # Or 'faster' for NVIDIA
```

> **Tip:** Model Selection
> For live streams, use smaller models (`tiny`, `base`) for lower latency. Accuracy is less critical than speed.

### Extension Settings

- **Operation Mode**: Tier 2 (Enhanced)
- **Target Language**: Your preferred language

---

## Limitations

1. **Delay** - There's inherent latency in transcription/translation
2. **Audio quality** - Depends on stream quality
3. **Multiple speakers** - May have difficulty with overlapping speech
4. **Music/SFX** - Background audio can affect transcription quality

---

## Tips for Better Results

### Reduce Latency

1. Use a smaller Whisper model (`tiny` or `base`)
2. Run backend locally for lowest network latency
3. Use Apple Silicon MLX or CUDA for hardware acceleration

### Improve Accuracy

1. Higher quality streams have clearer audio
2. Single-speaker streams work best
3. Gaming streams with commentary work well

### Handle Multiple Languages

If the streamer speaks multiple languages:

1. Subtide will detect language changes
2. Translation continues regardless of source language
3. Some mixing may occur during transitions

---

## VODs and Clips

Subtide also works with:

- **VODs** (Video on Demand) - Past broadcasts
- **Clips** - Short highlight clips
- **Highlights** - Curated stream moments

These function like regular videos with full translation support.

---

## Troubleshooting

### No audio captured

1. Ensure the stream is unmuted
2. Check browser permissions for audio
3. Verify the extension has necessary permissions

### High latency

1. Use a smaller Whisper model
2. Check your network connection
3. Run backend locally instead of remote

### Subtitles cutting off

1. Speech is being chunked for processing
2. This is normal for live content
3. Context is maintained between chunks
