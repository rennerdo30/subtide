# YouTube Shorts

Special features for YouTube Shorts with pre-translation for instant subtitles.

---

## Overview

YouTube Shorts are consumed rapidly with swipe behavior. On-demand translation would be too slow, so Subtide uses a **pre-translation** system:

1. **Detection** - Automatically detects all Shorts in your feed
2. **Pre-translation** - Translates 4+ videos ahead in the background
3. **Instant Display** - Cached subtitles appear immediately when you swipe

---

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to YouTube Shorts (`youtube.com/shorts/...`)
2. Look for the **floating translate button** in the bottom-right
3. Click to enable translation
4. Subtitles appear on the current video
5. **Swipe** to the next Short - subtitles appear instantly!

---

## Controls

### Floating Button

A circular button appears at the bottom-right of each Short:

- **Click** to toggle translation on/off
- **Color indicates status**:
    - Teal: Active and ready
    - Gray: Disabled

### Dropdown Menu

Click the arrow next to the button to access:

- **Language Selection** - Quick language picker
- **Subtitle Size** - S / M / L / XL options
- **Queue Status** - Shows translation progress

---

## Pre-Translation Queue

The queue system works in the background:

```
Queue Status: 4/4 ready

[Current] ✓ Translated
[Next 1]  ✓ Translated
[Next 2]  ✓ Translated
[Next 3]  ✓ Translated
[Next 4]  ⟳ Translating...
```

> **Info:** How It Works
> As you watch one Short, Subtide translates the next several videos in the background. When you swipe, subtitles are already cached and appear instantly.

---

## Subtitle Display

### Positioning

- **Default**: Centered near the bottom of the video
- **Draggable**: Click and drag to move anywhere
- **Reset**: Double-click to return to default

### Sizing

Choose a size that works for the vertical format:

| Size | Description |
|------|-------------|
| S | Minimal, unobtrusive |
| M | Balanced default |
| L | Easy to read |
| XL | Maximum visibility |

## Performance Tips

### Optimize Queue Size

The pre-translation queue loads 4+ videos ahead. For best experience:

1. **Stable connection** - Pre-translation needs consistent bandwidth
2. **Watch normally** - Don't skip too fast, let the queue build up
3. **First Short** - May take a moment while the queue initializes

### Backend Considerations

For YouTube Shorts, consider:

1. **Tier 2+** recommended for consistent quality
2. **Fast Whisper model** like `large-v3-turbo` for quick processing
3. **Local backend** for lowest latency

---

## Feed Detection

Subtide automatically detects Shorts in:

- Direct Shorts URLs (`youtube.com/shorts/xxxxx`)
- Shorts tab on channels
- Shorts appearing in search results
- Shorts in your home feed

---

## Limitations

1. **First video delay** - Initial Short may take a moment to translate
2. **Rapid skipping** - Skipping very fast may outpace the queue
3. **Live Shorts** - Not supported (no audio to transcribe)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Subtitles not appearing

1. Check that the floating button is visible
2. Ensure translation is enabled (teal color)
3. Wait a moment for the initial translation
4. Verify backend is running

### Queue not filling

1. Check your network connection
2. Verify backend health at `http://localhost:5001/health`
3. Check browser console for errors

### Subtitles disappear when swiping

1. This means the queue hasn't caught up
2. Watch the current Short a bit longer
3. The queue will pre-translate upcoming videos
