# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions and answers about Subtide.

---

## General Questions

### What is Subtide?

Subtide is an AI-powered browser extension that translates video subtitles in real-time. It works with YouTube, Twitch, and any website with video content.

### Is Subtide free?

Yes, Subtide is completely free and open-source under the MIT License. However, you'll need to provide your own API key for LLM translation services (OpenAI, OpenRouter, etc.) unless you run a local LLM.

### What languages are supported?

Subtide supports 13+ languages for translation:

| Language | Code |
|----------|------|
| English | `en` |
| Spanish | `es` |
| French | `fr` |
| German | `de` |
| Portuguese | `pt` |
| Russian | `ru` |
| Italian | `it` |
| Japanese | `ja` |
| Korean | `ko` |
| Chinese (Simplified) | `zh-CN` |
| Chinese (Traditional) | `zh-TW` |
| Arabic | `ar` |
| Hindi | `hi` |

Whisper can transcribe 90+ languages, so videos in other languages can be translated to the supported target languages.

### Does Subtide work offline?

Partially. You can run both the backend and LLM locally for fully offline operation:

1. Run the Subtide backend locally
2. Use a local LLM via [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) or [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/)

However, you'll still need internet to access the video content itself.

## Costs & Pricing

### How much does translation cost?

Costs depend on your API provider and model choice:

| Provider | Model | Approx. Cost per Video |
|----------|-------|------------------------|
| OpenAI | gpt-4o-mini | $0.001 - $0.01 |
| OpenAI | gpt-4o | $0.01 - $0.10 |
| OpenRouter | Various | Varies by model |
| Local LLM | Any | Free (electricity only) |

Costs vary based on video length and subtitle density.

### Can I use Subtide without paying?

Yes! You can:

1. **Use Tier 1** with existing YouTube captions (no Whisper needed)
2. **Run a local LLM** with LM Studio or Ollama (free after hardware)
3. **Use free API tiers** from some providers (limited usage)

### What's the cheapest setup?

For the lowest cost:

1. Use **Tier 1** (uses existing captions when available)
2. Use **gpt-4o-mini** (cheapest OpenAI model)
3. Or run a **local LLM** for zero API costs

## Technical Questions

### Which tier should I use?

| Use Case | Recommended Tier |
|----------|------------------|
| Videos with existing subtitles | Tier 1 |
| Videos without subtitles | Tier 2 |
| Shared/team deployment | Tier 3 |
| Real-time streaming subtitles | Tier 4 |

### What's the difference between Whisper backends?

| Backend | Best For | Performance |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **MLX** | Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3/M4) | Fastest on Mac |
| **Faster-Whisper** | NVIDIA GPUs | Fastest on NVIDIA |
| **OpenAI Whisper** | CPU fallback | Slowest but universal |

### What Whisper model should I use?

| Model | Memory | Quality | Speed | Best For |
|-------|--------|---------|-------|----------|
| `tiny` | ~1 GB | Basic | Fastest | Testing |
| `base` | ~1 GB | Good | Fast | Quick translations |
| `small` | ~2 GB | Better | Medium | Better accuracy |
| `medium` | ~5 GB | Great | Slow | High quality |
| `large-v3-turbo` | ~6 GB | Excellent | Fast | **Recommended** |
| `large-v3` | ~10 GB | Best | Slowest | Maximum quality |

**Recommendation**: Use `large-v3-turbo` for the best balance of speed and quality.

### Can I use this with live streams?

Yes, but with limitations:

- **YouTube Live**: Supported via Live Translation mode
- **Twitch**: Supported for live streams
- **Latency**: Expect 5-15 seconds delay for transcription + translation

### What video formats are supported?

Subtide works with any video using HTML5 `<video>` elements. This includes:

- YouTube (regular, Shorts, embedded)
- Twitch (live, VODs, clips)
- Most modern video players

**Not supported**:
- DRM-protected content (cannot access audio)
- Flash-based players (obsolete)
- Canvas-rendered video (non-standard)

## Quality Questions

### Why are my translations inaccurate?

Common causes and solutions:

1. **Poor audio quality** → Use a larger Whisper model
2. **Multiple speakers** → Enable speaker diarization
3. **Technical jargon** → Use a more capable LLM (gpt-4o)
4. **Fast speech** → Adjust playback speed
5. **Background noise** → Whisper handles this well, but extreme cases may struggle

### How can I improve translation quality?

1. **Use gpt-4o** instead of gpt-4o-mini for complex content
2. **Use large-v3-turbo** Whisper model
3. **Enable dual subtitles** to verify translations
4. **For Asian languages**, try Qwen models which excel at CJK

### Why are subtitles out of sync?

1. **Adjust sync** using the sync controls in the menu (+/- seconds)
2. **Reset position** by double-clicking the subtitles
3. **Try streaming mode** (Tier 4) for better sync

---

## Platform-Specific Questions

### Why doesn't the translate button appear on YouTube?

1. **Refresh the page** after installing the extension
2. **Disable conflicting extensions** that modify YouTube's UI
3. **Check extension permissions** in chrome://extensions
4. **Clear browser cache** and reload

### Do YouTube Shorts work differently?

Yes! Shorts use a **pre-translation** system:

1. Videos are translated **before** you swipe to them
2. A queue of 4+ videos is maintained ahead
3. Subtitles appear **instantly** when you swipe

This compensates for the rapid swiping behavior of Shorts.

### Does this work with YouTube Premium?

Yes, Subtide works the same with or without YouTube Premium.

### Can I use this on embedded YouTube videos?

Yes, Subtide detects embedded YouTube players on other websites. All features work the same.

## Privacy & Security

### Does Subtide collect my data?

No. Subtide:

- Does **not** collect personal data
- Does **not** track your viewing history
- Does **not** send data to third parties
- All processing happens locally or via your chosen API provider

### Where is my API key stored?

Your API key is stored locally in Chrome's extension storage. It is:

- Never sent to Subtide servers
- Only sent to the API provider you configure
- Encrypted by Chrome's storage API

### Is the backend secure?

The backend:

- Runs locally by default
- Does not store any data permanently
- Only processes videos you explicitly translate
- Can be firewalled to localhost only
