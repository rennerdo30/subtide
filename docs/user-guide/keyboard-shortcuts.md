## Custom Shortcuts

Currently, shortcuts are not customizable. The default shortcuts are chosen to:

- Avoid conflicts with YouTube's native shortcuts
- Be easy to remember
- Work across all platforms

## Conflict Resolution

If shortcuts don't work, check for conflicts:

### YouTube Native Shortcuts

Some YouTube shortcuts that may seem similar:

- `C` - Toggle captions (YouTube native)
- `T` - Theater mode (conflicts - Subtide overrides when active)

### Browser Shortcuts

Browser shortcuts take priority over page shortcuts.

### Site-Specific Shortcuts

Some sites have their own keyboard shortcuts that may conflict.

2. **Click first**: Always ensure the video has focus
3. **Fullscreen**: Shortcuts work in fullscreen mode
4. **Quick toggle**: Use `T` to quickly hide subtitles during action scenes
