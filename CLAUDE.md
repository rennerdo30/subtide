# Project Guidelines for Claude

## Git Commit Rules

- Do NOT commit review files (e.g., CODE_REVIEW.md, REVIEW.md, or similar temporary analysis documents)
- Review files should be deleted or added to .gitignore before committing

## Testing Requirements

- Goal is to have as close to 100% unit test coverage as possible
- All new features and bug fixes should include corresponding unit tests
- Run tests before committing to ensure nothing is broken
